# Python variable rules
# •	 Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores. 
# They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number. 
# For instance, you can call a variable message_1 but not 1_message.
# •	 Spaces are not allowed in variable names, but underscores can be used 
# to separate words in variable names. For example, greeting_message works 
# but greeting message will cause errors.
# •	 Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names. 
# For example, do not use the word print as a variable name; Python 
# has reserved it for a particular programmatic purpose. (See “Python 
# Keywords and Built-in Functions” on page 466.)
# •	 Variable names should be short but descriptive. For example, name is 
# better than n, student_name is better than s_n, and name_length is better 
# than length_of_persons_name.
# •	 Be careful when using the lowercase letter l and the uppercase letter O
# because they could be confused with the numbers 1 and 0
