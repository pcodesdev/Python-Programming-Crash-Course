# Python calls any number with a decimal point a float. 
# Integers and Floats
# Underscores in Numbers
# When you’re writing long numbers, you can group digits using underscores 
# to make large numbers more readable:
# >>> universe_age = 14_000_000_000
# Multiple Assignment
# You can assign values to more than one variable using just a single line of 
# code. This can help shorten your programs and make them easier to read; 
# you’ll use this technique most often when initializing a set of numbers.
# For example, here’s how you can initialize the variables x, y, and z to zero:
# >>> x, y, z = 0, 0, 0

# Constants
# A constant is a variable whose value stays the same throughout the life of a 
# program.
# Python programmers use all capital letters to indicate a viariable should be treated as a constant and never be changed
# MAX_CONNECTIONS = 5000
